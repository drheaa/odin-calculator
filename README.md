# Calculator â€“ The Odin Project

This project is part of the [Foundations course](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-calculator) from The Odin Project.  
The goal of this project is to create a functional calculator that operates as a web application, allowing users to perform basic arithmetic operations. Through this project, I practiced and improved my understanding of **JavaScript**, **DOM manipulation**, **event handling**, and **styling** with **CSS**.

## About

The Calculator is a simple web application that replicates the functionality of a basic calculator.  
It features:
- Basic arithmetic operations: **addition**, **subtraction**, **multiplication**, and **division**.
- A clear button to reset the display.
- A button to perform calculations and show the result.
- A responsive design that works across devices.

The calculator was built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, focusing on clean, maintainable code and a user-friendly interface.

## Key Learning Points

While working on this project, I focused on the following concepts:

- **DOM Manipulation**: Creating and managing dynamic elements such as buttons and the display using JavaScript.
- **Event Handling**: Using event listeners to capture button clicks and update the display and results accordingly.
- **JavaScript Functions**: Implementing reusable functions to perform basic mathematical operations and handle edge cases like division by zero.
- **Responsive Design**: Making the application mobile-friendly by using media queries to adjust the layout and button sizes.

## Skills Demonstrated

- **JavaScript**: Implementing calculator logic, handling button presses, and performing arithmetic operations.
- **HTML**: Structuring the user interface with buttons, a display area, and layout elements.
- **CSS**: Styling the calculator with a clean, modern, and responsive design, ensuring good user experience across screen sizes.
- **Problem-Solving**: Handling edge cases such as dividing by zero and ensuring that inputs are handled appropriately.

## Future Enhancements

- **Decimal and Float Handling**: Add support for decimals and floating-point precision.
- **Keyboard Support**: Enable the use of the keyboard to interact with the calculator for better accessibility.
- **Advanced Operations**: Implement more advanced mathematical functions like square root, exponentiation, and trigonometric operations.
- **Error Handling**: Improve error handling for invalid input or sequences of operations.

## How to Use

1. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
2. Click on any of the numeric or operator buttons to enter a number or operation.
3. Click the `=` button to see the result of the calculation.
4. Click `C` to clear the calculator and reset the display.

## Conclusion

This project helped solidify my understanding of how to interact with the DOM using JavaScript, and it gave me valuable experience in building a user interface and handling user input dynamically. I look forward to implementing more complex functionality in future projects.

Feel free to explore, and I welcome any suggestions or feedback.
